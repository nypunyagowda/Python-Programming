## 🐍 Python Scripts Included

### 1. IOT Folder

- **SensorData.py**  
  Reads or simulates raw sensor readings and demonstrates how to capture and store them.

- **Smoothened Data.py**  
  Applies smoothing or filtering techniques to raw sensor data to reduce noise before analysis.

- **Virtual Sensor.py**  
  Simulates a virtual sensor that generates or transforms data programmatically.

- **Visualize the reading matplotlib.py**  
  Uses `matplotlib` to plot and visualize IoT sensor data so trends and patterns are easier to interpret.

### 2. DataProcessing

  **Example: clean_data.py** – Cleans raw datasets, handles missing values, normalizes data.

  **Example: transform_data.py** – Transforms datasets for analysis or visualization.

### 3. Algorithms

  **Sorting algorithms**: bubble_sort.py, quick_sort.py, etc.

  **Searching algorithms**: linear_search.py, binary_search.py.

  **Recursion exercises**: factorial.py, fibonacci.py.

### 4. WebScraping

  **scrape_weather.py** – Scrapes weather data from a public API or website.

  **scrape_stock.py** – Collects stock prices or financial data automatically.

### 5. Visualizations

  **plot_sales.py** – Example program to visualize sales data using matplotlib.

  **plot_distribution.py** – Plots histograms, scatter plots, and other distributions.
  
### 6. LearningPhase

  **basic_loops.py** – Demonstrates loops and conditionals.

  **functions_demo.py** – Shows functions and parameter passing.

  **oop_example.py** – Basic object-oriented programming examples in Python.

### 7. Others

Miscellaneous scripts for experiments or learning exercises.
